# Spacemacs
VIM is my jam don't get me wrong but, in any case where I *can* use Spacemacs I will. It's just: amazing.
I've used this VIM setup for a couple of years now and I can honestly say I doubt I will return to using VIM full-time -
even if NeoVim becomes more than a dream.

### That said,
if you want a decent VIM setup I would say give this one a shot. It's easy to use: just clone the repo somewhere
and run the install.sh script. It just makes symbolic links in your home directory. Easy. For all of the plugins and stuff
you will need Vundle and then of course there's tmux and powerline for tmux.

### Tmux
Tmux is also my jam. The config binds Ctrl+a as its leader. Pretty much all you need to know is: Ctrl+a then,
- `q+<number>`
- `h/H,j/J,k/K,l/L`
- `c`
- `<num>`
